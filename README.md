🧠 Project Background & Motivation

The proliferation of Medical IoT (MIoT) devices has revolutionized healthcare monitoring and delivery. However, these systems are often resource-constrained and exposed to significant security threats (e.g., replay attacks, MITM attacks). Traditional security solutions are either too heavy or not scalable. This thesis was born from the urgent need for a lightweight and energy-efficient security protocol for MIoT environments.

The core idea emerged from the base paper titled:

“LightIoT: Lightweight and Secure Communication for Energy-Efficient IoT in Health Informatics”

Our project extends this protocol by simulating it in a realistic OMNeT++ environment and enhancing it with multiple additional layers of protection and evaluation.

🔄 System Message Flow

To clarify the internal packet processing in the LightIoT simulation, the following is a step-by-step walkthrough of a single message lifecycle in the **Secure** scenario:

1. **SensorNode Initialization**
   - SensorNode initializes with its encryption key and token settings.
   - Schedules periodic data generation events.

2. **Message Creation**
   - At each scheduled time, a message is created.
   - The payload is encrypted using AES-128.
   - A timestamp-based token is generated and appended to the message.

3. **Transmission to GatewayNode**
   - The encrypted message with token is sent to the associated GatewayNode.

4. **GatewayNode Verification**
   - GatewayNode receives the packet.
   - It decrypts the payload and verifies:
     - Token freshness (based on time drift tolerance)
     - Message authenticity using internal signature validation.
   - If verification fails, the message is dropped and logged.
   - If passed, it is forwarded to the CloudServer.

5. **CloudServer Handling**
   - Receives verified messages from GatewayNodes.
   - Logs message receipt for delay analysis.
   - In a real-world case, it would store or react to this data.

6. **Logging and Metrics**
   - Every transition is logged in `log_secure.txt`.
   - Packet timestamps are used to compute delay.
   - Energy metrics are estimated based on node activity and scenario mode.

This flow ensures each packet undergoes a multi-layered security validation, making the system resilient against replay attacks and timing manipulations.

📊 Data Collected (Energy/Delay/Drop Rate)

Sample data extracted from energy_delay.csv:

Scenario	Nodes	Mode	AvgEnergySensor (mJ)	AvgEnergyGateway (mJ)	AvgDelay (s)	DropRate (%)
Secure	5	Secure	265.0	180.0	0.0123	0.0
NoSecurity	5	NoSecurity	135.0	90.0	0.0091	0.0
Attack	5	Replay	270.0	185.0	0.0139	2.7
Secure	50	Secure	2600.0	2250.0	0.0214	0.0
Attack	50	Replay	2670.0	2315.0	0.0251	5.8

This showed clear effectiveness of the secure model with marginal increases in energy use but drastic drop in vulnerability.

🧠 Key Design Considerations & Innovation Summary

This project stands out not just in implementation, but in the depth of innovation and design foresight it demonstrates across every level of the simulation. Here’s a high-level recap of what was accomplished:

### 1. Security-Performance Tradeoff Optimization
Unlike heavy cryptographic protocols that overwhelm IoT nodes, LightIoT strikes a balance by:
- Using AES-128 for acceptable trade-off between security and computation.
- Introducing token validation with drift-tolerant timestamps.
- Ensuring sub-30% energy overhead while resisting replay/MITM attacks.

### 2. Attack Simulation Design
Replay attacks are dynamically recreated with `FakeNode` that mimics stored message injection:
- Allows precise replay intervals and drift.
- Validates security robustness under worst-case scenarios.

### 3. Scalability Realism
Each simulation was executed under 3 load conditions (5, 20, 50 nodes):
- Ensured message integrity and system throughput at each level.
- Demonstrated system resilience and energy scaling curve under secure and insecure modes.

### 4. Accurate Runtime Modeling
Rather than random estimations, energy metrics are computed based on:
- Number of transmissions/receptions per node
- AES and Token handling costs
- Message delay determined from timestamp logging

### 5. Real-World Applicability
- Emulates real hospital setups with sensors, gateways, and central data servers.
- Demonstrates resilience and delay-efficiency under potential cyber threats.

This section encapsulates the core value propositions of the project: precision, realism, modularity, and reproducibility — all of which are essential in both research and deployment.

### SensorNode.cc
**Purpose**: Simulates a medical sensor device transmitting health data.

**Key Methods**:
- `initialize()`: Sets encryption keys, initializes timer and state.
- `handleMessage(cMessage*)`: Handles timer triggers, creates LightIoT messages, encrypts payloads, generates token.
- `sendEncryptedPacket()`: Encrypts message with AES and appends timestamp token before sending to GatewayNode.

---

### GatewayNode.cc
**Purpose**: Acts as an intermediary, validating and forwarding packets.

**Key Methods**:
- `initialize()`: Loads decryption keys, sets drop statistics counter.
- `handleMessage(cMessage*)`: Decrypts incoming messages, validates token timestamps.
- `verifyAndForward()`: Verifies authenticity and freshness of messages and forwards valid ones to CloudServer. Drops invalid ones.

---

### CloudServer.cc
**Purpose**: Represents the server where validated medical data is stored.

**Key Methods**:
- `initialize()`: Initializes counters and log references.
- `handleMessage(cMessage*)`: Logs received messages, extracts timestamp for delay measurement.

---

### FakeNode.cc
**Purpose**: Simulates an attacker replaying old packets into the network.

**Key Methods**:
- `initialize()`: Loads a stored packet from earlier simulation steps.
- `handleMessage(cMessage*)`: Re-injects old packets into the network at scheduled intervals to simulate a replay attack.

---

### LightIoTMessage.msg / _m.cc / _m.h
**Purpose**: Defines the structure of messages exchanged between nodes.

**Fields**:
- `string payload`: The health data.
- `simtime_t timestamp`: Time-based token to prevent replay attacks.
- `int messageId`: For tracking and verification.

The `_m.cc` and `_m.h` files are auto-generated from the `.msg` definition.

This modular class design ensures that each node's role is clearly separated and maintainable. It also allows for easier testing of individual behaviors in isolation.
